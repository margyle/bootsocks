bootsocks
=========

Bootsocks grabs color palette info from Colourovers.com and outputs a user.css file for customizing bootstrap.

Bootsocks is a proof of concept at this point and not functional in this form, I will update when I have some time. It uses the Colourlovers API library from: https://github.com/brianhaveri/Colour-Lovers-PHP
